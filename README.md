## Career Counselling
Since primary school, I’ve been passionate about tech and fascinated by games. As I grew older, my curiosity about how games and apps are built only deepened.

High school was a turning point—seeing my cousin stay up late studying with stacks of books inspired me. I approached her one day and asked what she was learning. She told me she was studying Information Technology, which involves building applications and working with technology. That moment sparked my interest in tech even more and set me on a path to explore and learn about the exciting world of IT.

My cousin helped me understand career options in Information Technology but out of all of them Applications development stood out the most.

## Skills & Interests

While pursuing my studies in Information and Communication Technology, I became deeply interested in how digital systems are designed and how applications function behind the scenes.

I set out to develop both my frontend design and backend development skills to bridge the gap between user experience and system logic.

I created intuitive wireframes and interactive prototypes using Figma, turning abstract ideas into user-friendly interface designs. On the backend, I designed relational databases and wrote efficient SQL queries to manage structured data. I also built and maintained clean, modular codebases in Java, applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and debugging to ensure optimal performance.

These experiences improved my logical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities. I’m now confident in designing seamless user experiences and building scalable backend systems. I continue to explore how thoughtful design and solid development practices can come together to create meaningful, reliable applications.

## Personality Assessment

Understanding my personality has helped me with my self-awareness and choose environments where I thrive pe that value structure, collaboration, and purpose. As someone with an ESFJ Consul personality, I am naturally drawn to roles where I can support others and bring order to complex situations.

I see myself as reliable, empathetic, and highly organized. These traits influence the way I work on projects whether it’s maintaining clarity in a team or ensuring the processes run smoothly behind the scenes. My motivation often comes from helping others succeed, and I find real fulfillment in being part of something that improves people’s lives or experiences.

I prefer settings where communication is open and responsibilities are clearly defined. I am constantly learning to balance my drive to support others with the need to set boundaries and care for my own wellbeing. I’ve also grown more comfortable with feedback, using it as a tool for improvement rather than taking it personally.

Traits that could support my growth and effectiveness in a team or technical environment:

- Strong sense of duty and follow-through

- Empathy that strengthens team collaboration

- Natural ability to organize and manage time

- A desire to contribute positively to group goals

- Attention to detail and pride in well-done work

These has helped me build  meaningful relationships and contribute in ways that are both thoughtful and dependable. Understanding personality is not just about personality labels, for me its about about making intentional choices, building healthier habits, and carving a career path that feels both authentic and rewarding.
